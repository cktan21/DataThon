       "29    [On 13 February 2005, the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (ID/OIOS) received a request from UNON Official 1 to inquire into allegations that locally recruited United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) staff may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the United Nations Co-operative Savings and Credit Society Limited (UN-SACCO), which operates within UNON premises., The request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to UNON Management by UNON Official 2, on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the Nairobi-based United Nations Children’s Fund/Somalia Support Centre (UNICEF/Somalia) obtained UN-SACCO loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to UN-SACCO. The primary concern of UNON Management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to UNON and other Nairobi-based United Nations Agencies., At the time of the request, two ID/OIOS Investigators were on mission to Nairobi on another matter, but given the concerns expressed by UNON Managers, the ID/OIOS Investigators were directed by ID/OIOS Management to look into this matter with celerity, and did so, from 14 through 18 February 2005., The purpose of this report is to present the findings of the preliminary ID/OIOS Investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by UNON Management.]\n",
