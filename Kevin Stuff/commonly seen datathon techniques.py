NLP (Natrual Language Process)
- How to derive meaning from human languages 

Techniques 
a. Segmentisation 
- Split it based on space/comma/puncutation 

Example 
'I heEARD SUFFERING MAKES one wiser, im about to make you very wise today'

#Tranform 
['I heEARD SUFFERING MAKES one wiser' , 'im about to make you very wise today']

b. Tokenising 
- split to its individual words 
['I', 'heEARD', 'SUFFERING', 'MAKES', 'one', 'wiser' , 'im', 'about', 'to', 'make', 'you', 'very' ,'wise' 'today']

c. Stop words 
- get rid of non functional words ie and, are, was, in

d.
