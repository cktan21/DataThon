'Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of disciplinary measures for misconduct.']   \n",

      "11  [Per agreements between UNDP, UNHQ and UNON, UNDP country offices provide a range of administrative services, including cash disbursements, related to programme implementation for United Nations agencies., The UNDP country offices record the layout of funds on Inter Office Vouchers (IOV) and bill the various agencies for these services on a monthly basis by preparing a Report AT 036 for each agency, which has appended to it copies of all IOVs for that agency for the month., The original AT 036 report and its attachments are sent to UNDP HQ New York by diplomatic pouch and a copy is sent to the agency., Report AT 036 is thereafter filed in the UNDP country finance files. In UNDP Bratislava, copies are not kept of the attachments and the Report AT 036 does not enumerate them. This office processes about 25 cash disbursements a month., In October 2003, UNON Finance was reconciling its accounts with UNDP Bratislava and noted there was an outstanding IOV from August 2002., UNON Finance could not locate the August 2002 Report AT 036 or its attachments. It requested these materials from UNDP Bratislava and determined that there were two cash disbursement vouchers which could not be reconciled: two lump sum payments to The Consultant, in the amounts of US$5,814 and US$4,265, for travel to Johannesburg and Monrovia to attend Ozone Secretariat conferences in August 2002 and September 2002 respectively., UNON finance determined that these two vouchers were based on a genuine travel request authorization which had been sent from UNON to the UNDP Bratislava office on 25 June 2002., The two travel requests of The Consultant changed certain details of the genuine fax, including the name of the payee, the date, comments and the UNON fax number which is unique to each UNON fax and is assigned in the UNON cable room, but retained, amongst other items, the names and signatures of the authorizing officers, and the Travel Request number, which is specific to each request., UNON finance concluded that the faxes which instructed UNDP Bratislava to make these payments were forged., Furthermore, UNEP confirmed that there were no meetings in Johannesburg and Monrovia in 2002, that The Consultant was not UNEP’s consultant, and that payment of lump sums to consultants for travel was irregular in any event.]   \n",

The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999, UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport., Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm., On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV.

The purchase of additional FIDS became necessary because of the expansion of the Passenger Terminal Building.

At present, UN-SACCO has a capital of US $ 13.5 million with about 2,500 members, and is managed by a Management Committee elected at an annual General Meeting of the Society on a renewable three-year term., In order to become a UN-SACCO member, a staff member of the United Nations completes an 'Application for Membership' form (Attachment 2) and pays a fee of Kshs. 500 (about US $ 7). UN-SACCO members own shares and can request and obtain individual loans after holding membership in UN-SACCO for six months. Members may apply for a loan up to three times the value of their shares. The length of the loans cannot extend beyond the term of employment by the United Nations., To obtain an individual loan, a staff member is required to complete either a 'Loan Application & Loan Agreement Form' (Attachment 3) or an 'Instant Loan Facility Application & Agreement Form' (Attachment 4). The staff member must attach to his/her request documents including copies of his/her latest payslip, National Identification Card or Passport and a copy of his/her letter of contract., A copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds a valid contract, which covers the agreed period of time for the repayment of the loan. The benefit of a longer contract is that it permits repayment in lesser amounts over a longer period of time., To ensure guarantee of repayment, the applicant must provide up to six guarantors in the event of the borrower’s default. The guarantors must also be UN-SACCO members., The applications for loans are reviewed by UN-SACCO staff and a Credit Committee, which approve, defer, or reject the application.]   \n",

Vendor 2 took part together in three Airport tenders put other competitors at a disadvantage., Doubts whether both companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 4 exist and submitted bids for the three tenders., The ITF investigation found no reference with regard to the existence of the alleged competitor Vendor 4 in Pristina., The alleged company Vendor 3 was found to be a supermarket located in Prizren., The above-mentioned facts are already part of the ITF case no. 286/04 that was submitted to the International Prosecutor, UNMIK Department of Justice, in October 2004.]   \n",
      "1   [This investigation relates to two tenders for contracts for the purchase of winter and summer uniforms for staff members of Pristina Airport. The value of the contract for the purchase of winter uniforms was €157,060 and the contract for the purchase of summer uniforms was €24,997., Allegations 1 & 2 (It is alleged that the highest bid received for the winter uniforms was accepted, when it was almost twice the cost of the two further bids received); and (It is alleged there was insufficient information on the bid evaluation sheets as to why the offer from the third company was incomplete). A bid evaluation report dated 6 December 2002 indicates that 8 firms were issued with documents and 4 bids were submitted. The bids were opened on 27 November 2002. The report indicates at page 3 that Vendor 3’s offer in the sum of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1 (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850), which were rejected. The reason specified for rejection of the bid by Vendor 1 on page four of the evaluation was that the evaluation committee asked the company to produce a specimen of each type of uniform and it failed to do so. This is confirmed in a letter to Vendor 1 dated 27 November 2002. A similar letter was delivered to Vendor 3. The evaluation report also concluded that the company Vendor 1 has one manufacturer in Peja, which can’t offer the required quality and had too long a date for completion., In the case of Vendor 2, the evaluation report states that the company provided an incomplete offer. When asked in what manner the offer was incomplete in interview, the Procurement Officer, a member of the Evaluation Committee, stated that Vendor 2 submitted an offer, which did not contain all the required articles. The Procurement Officer was asked why his/her explanation was not put in the tender evaluation. He/she replied that it was due to his/her lack of English. In view of the fact that the evaluation committee all signed the evaluation report, they would have been aware of the reason for Vendor 2’s rejection. The ITF contacted Vendor 2 and requested it to provide a copy of the tender documents in order verify whether or not its offer was incomplete. However, the company did not deliver any documents, or provide any information other than the name of the person who delivered the documents and samples for the tender to Pristina Airport. The ITF was therefore unable to verify the Procurement Officer’s explanation. The explanation in the evaluation report that Vendor 1 produced uniforms which were of lower quality, together with the explanation given by the Procurement Officer in interview that Vendor 2 submitted an offer which did not contain all the required articles, may account in part for the difference in price between the offer from Vendor 3 and the lower offers from Vendor 2 and Vendor 1. However, the price difference is of concern. A letter of notification and a signed contract dated 6 December 2002 confirm that Vendor 3 was awarded the contract for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenance personnel for the winter season., Allegation 3 (It is alleged that the capital expenditure approval for the winter uniforms contract was signed on 10 January 2003, after the contract and a letter of notification to the company had already been signed on 6 December 2002). A capital expenditure approval for the winter uniforms contract appears to have been signed by the Divisional Manager on 10 January 2003, after a letter of notification to the company and the contract had already been signed on 6 December 2002. In view of the necessity to have expenditure authorised prior to signature of a contract, the PEAP Official and the Divisional Manager were asked in interview why the contract appeared to be signed before the capital expenditure had been approved. The PEAP Official indicated that although the contract was dated 6 December 2004, the actual date of signature for the contract was the protocol stamp on the contract, which was 14 January 2003. The Divisional Manager stated that there was no date indicating when the contract was signed and added that the date on the contract would not necessarily correspond with the date on which the contract has been signed. He/she added that the evidence was not conclusive that the contract had been signed before capital expenditure approval was obtained. The Divisional Manager added that he/she assumed the protocol stamp date of 14 January 2003 was the date that the contract was returned to the Airport. A better indicator as to the date on which the contract was signed is contained in a routing slip from the Procurement Officer to Official 4 of Pillar IV, and the KTA Official dated 13 January 2003. The routing slip states 'your signatures are required before we present the contract to the selected supplier.' This suggests that the contract may not have been signed until 13 January 2003, (i.e. after capital expenditure approval had been obtained)., Allegation 4 (It is alleged that the value of the contract for summer uniforms was irregularly set at €3 below the limit requiring a competitive tender). On 3 April 2003 an invitation to quote for the supply of uniforms for the summer season was sent out to 4 companies, of which 3 submitted quotes / bids by the deadline of 11 April 2003. The offers received were evaluated and Vendor 3 awarded the contract. A contract was signed by Vendor 3 on 12 April 2003 and countersigned by the Divisional Manager on 18 April 2003. The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997) was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shopping. This gives rise to concerns that the offer was set at a level to avoid the necessity for a competitive tender. Whilst there is no evidence that this was deliberately done, a second offer was received from the company Vendor 2 in the sum of €39,541.00. In view of the fact that the evaluation report indicates that contract to be approximately €25,000 it is questionable as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather than competitive shopping., Allegation 5 (It is alleged that the companies Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 were invited to tender for the summer uniforms contract when the evaluation report for the winter uniforms indicated that Vendor 1 could not offer the quality of uniforms required and Vendor 2 produced an incomplete offer, thereby affording an advantage to the supplier of the winter uniforms, Vendor 3). The evaluation report and tender documents indicate that two companies Vendor 2 and Vendor 1 were requested to provide competitive bids, in spite of the fact that some five months earlier, Vendor 2’s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected by the evaluation committee as incomplete, as it had not included all the items requested; whilst Vendor 1’s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected on the basis that it had one manufacturer in Peja which could not offer the required quality. The opinion of the winter uniforms evaluation committee concerning Vendor 1 was repeated in the findings of the summer uniforms evaluation committee, which was indicated by the Procurement Officer to have rejected Vendor 1’s offer on the grounds that its offer for the uniforms was not responsive from the cut and quality point of view. The grounds for the two rejections gave rise to concerns that the inclusion of the two companies in the tender for summer uniforms may have afforded an advantage to Vendor 3, the eventual winner. Having analysed the available evidence and carried out research into the two companies, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region, although doubts about the Vendor 1’s suitability to participate in the summer competitive shopping exercise remain. The Procurement Officer, a member of the evaluation committee, stated in the course of his/her interview that the companies were invited by one of the PEAP secretaries Secretary 1 or Secretary 2. The PEAP Official also indicated that the worker who took delivery of the summer uniforms was Secretary 2. Due to Secretary 2’s possible connection with another more serious criminal case, involving alleged payments of money in return for jobs at Pristina Airport, (ITF Case 0377/04) a decision was taken by the ITF not to interview Secretary 2 concerning the choice of companies invited to submit bids in the competitive shopping procedure, in order to avoid any possible prejudice to the more serious case. A decision was also taken not to interview Vendor 3 representative, concerning this case due to the fact that he/she was one of the principal suspects in the same criminal case. Whilst there are some doubts as to the inclusion of Vendor 1, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region. In view of this, the ITF does not find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such a manner as to provide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3., Allegation 6 (It is alleged that the invitations to quote for summer uniforms sent out to the companies contained differing quantities of items). The two invitations to quote for summer uniforms submitted by the companies Vendor 3 and Vendor 1 contain different quantities of items from that submitted by the company Vendor 2. Whilst it is accepted that the price of the offer received from Vendor 2 was much higher than the other two, it raised a question as to whether different quantities of items may have been sent to competing companies. When asked about the differences in the quantities of items, the Procurement Officer stated that the quantities were changed and revised documents sent out to all the companies before the deadline to submit the offers had ended. He/she added that the Airport, as the procuring entity had the right to do so. In view of this response, the company Ven...   \n",

It also deals with a further single source contract Annex Agreement Ref ACTS/PA/COC/W 02-02 for the supply of new offices, training room and maintenance garage for the Rescue Fire Fighting Service. The value of the main contract was €263,093 and the Annex Agreement €33,927., Allegation 1 (Extra work to the value of €25 935.74 was added to the main contract for the construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services, without any supporting documentation detailing the nature of the extra works or appropriate authorisation): A bid evaluation report dated 30 September 2002 indicates that following an evaluation of 9 bids the contract for the construction of garages and a parking area for Air Traffic Control Services was awarded to a the company in Pristina. A bid evaluation report letter from the ATCS Procurement Officer at Pristina Airport dated 1 October 2002 indicates that the Vendor was selected as having the lowest price (€263,093) of the three companies selected for further evaluation. A contract dated 30 September 2002 was signed with the Vendor by ATCS at Pristina Airport on 11 October 2002. A schedule of payments for the main contract indicates that a sum of €25, 935.74 was added to the cost of the contract. However, there are no documents in the contract file indicating the nature of the extra works or under what procedure they were authorised. When asked about this issue by the ITF, the Divisional Manager stated that he/she would have expected to see a schedule of extra works in the contract file. However, it was not in the file. He/she therefore could not state to what the extra works related or under what procedure they were authorised. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the nature of the works and the whereabouts of supporting documentation, stated that the request for the extra expenditure came from KFOR. He/she added that he/she was sure there was a justification from KFOR to carry out the extra works and that it had been agreed in all the meetings between KFOR, UNMIK and the Airport. On 6 October 2004, an ATCS Employee, provided ITF Investigators an explanation for the extra work and produced a spreadsheet detailing how the figures had been determined. According to the ATCS Employee, there had been an arithmetical error in the bill of quantities for the main contract, which had not been picked up by the evaluation committee. This had resulted in a reduction in the price of the contract from €263,093 to €260,726.81. ATCS Official 2 had subtracted the sum attributable to this arithmetical error from the contract, (€2366.19) and then carried out a review of the specifications. The review had resulted in a figure of €265,034.62 (€1941.62 more than the stated contract price of €263,093) due to items missed in the bill of quantities. Additional ground stabilisation work totalling €23,994.08 was then added to the specification review work, amounting to the difference between the original contract price of €263,093 and the final invoice price of €289,028.74, giving a total of €25,935.57 for extra work. This explanation was later confirmed by ATCS Official 2 in a further meeting with the ITF on 20 October 2004. ATCS Official 2 also confirmed that the extra work had not been recorded in written form, as it followed a visit to the construction site by the Divisional Manager and ATCS Official 1. In summary, there are no documentary records to support the extra works. The only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €25,935.74 for extra works., Allegation 2 (The Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his authorisation limit of €25, 000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated from the normal procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds); and Allegation 3 (Extra work to the value of €1,390 was added to the Annex Agreement without any supporting documentation indicating either the nature of the extra works or appropriate authorisation): A note from KFOR to ATCS Official 1 and the Divisional Manager dated 21 January 2003 attaching minutes of a meeting dated 7 January 2003, indicates that an urgent request was made for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices, in anticipation of Iceland taking over from Italy as 'Lead Nation' in March 2003. An annex agreement in the sum of €33,927 was signed with the Vendor for construction of a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices on 7 February 2003, supported by a justification from the Divisional Manager also dated 7 February 2003. A schedule of payments dated 19 March 2003 relating to the annex agreement indicates that a sum of €1,390 was added to the cost of the contract. However, there are no documents in the contract file indicating the nature of the extra works or under what procedure they were authorised. When asked about the extra payment in interview, the Divisional Manager indicated that from the documents presented to him/her (specifically the contract file) he/she could not say what the extra works were. He/she added that without looking at the works covered by the contract he/she could not know whether or not there was any provision for extra expenditure. ATCS Official 1, when asked about the extra payment in interview stated that he/she would have to check airport administration records and provide this information. On 27 September 2004, ATCS Official 1 had a meeting with the ITF at which he/she indicated that the extra work related to a request from KFOR for a stair rail and the creation of a storage space under the stairs of the training offices for fire fighter’s breathing equipment, together with office partitioning for the fire-fighter’s offices. In support of this, he/she produced a copy of a manuscript diary entry and a note dated 27 September 2004, drawn up by the Vendor, listing these items as the extra works carried out. This indicates that there was no supporting documentation for the extra work when it was carried out. The only financial documentation on file authorising the extra works appears to be a signed schedule of payments, which includes the provision of €1,390 for extra works., Allegation 4 (It is alleged that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval prior to authorising expenditure for the Annex Agreement to construct a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices): A capital expenditure approval dated 4 March 2003 shows that the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €25,000. In addition, the document indicates that the work had already been completed by the time that financial approval was sought for the expenditure.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €180,816.00., Allegation 1: It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April 2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003. However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1 stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper description of the cabins in their bid documents. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender., Allegation 2: It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process. The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and 15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15 altogether., Second tender: A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her interview. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a bid. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2. There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national company. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria, came at a high price.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €774,318.63., Allegation 1: Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings and plans., A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluation Company to the PEAP Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was commissioned to produce a preliminary design for the Cargo Terminal at Pristina Airport. The design also provided for the construction of the Cargo Apron Extension., A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the Cargo Apron Extension. Four companies submitted bids, and following an evaluation, the contract was awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for the Cargo Apron Extension on 11 September 2001., A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 9 May 2001 indicates that it submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include what appears to be a section from the preliminary design documents produced by the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a section entitled 'Bills of Quantities' from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design documents., An interoffice memorandum providing an 'outstanding issues update to Official 2', from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the office of Official 2 dated 18 May 2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance. However, a more likely explanation is the date of the interoffice memorandum has been incorrectly dated, since the document contains reference dates relating to project 'events' which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation to tender was based on summary documents., At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension evaluation report dated 2 August 2001, the committee notes that the bidding documents did not include clear instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Vendor, on further details of the scope of works., In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds., When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question, he/she would indicate that the tender specifications were technically deficient and did not comply with Article 23.3., DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification., According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to review and help him with the procurement exercise., Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer, and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications., DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work very difficult., Allegations 2 & 3: Specifically, three of the persons on the bid opening committee and evaluation committees were the same parties who should not have carried out both tasks and the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is signed by three parties, who are also listed as having attended the bid opening session. This indicates that the composition of the bid opening committee and the evaluation committee overlapped., When asked about this issue in interview DOTI Official 2 confirmed that he/she was both on the bid opening committee and was a member of the evaluation committee. He/she added that the people who evaluated the offers signed the evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regulations, which segregate the two roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September 2001 indicates that the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., Allegation 4: Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest., An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original contract., DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it carried out its own soil tests., A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 September 2003 suggests that the Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby 'self certifying' its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5, reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay liquidated damages in the event that the 'load-bearing' capacity of the apron is less than foreseen in the contract, upon completion of the work, the contract is silent as to whom should carry out the tests. However, it is questionable as to whether the Vendor should have carried it out, since it presents a conflict of interest., When asked about this in interview, the Divisional Manager stated: 'Without seeing any other documents, on the face of it, it does appear that there could be a conflict of interest here. But the report was produced by a professional pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree of integrity.', The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she commented that the airport engineer should have questioned it., The ITF does not have sufficient technical knowledge to assess the adequacy of the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divisional Manager to Staff Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the possibility that it was not up to specification in certain areas.]   \n",

                               [This case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at Pristina Airport arising from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in the period January – December 2001. The case also deals with allegations of corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times., Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in 2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact that fees appear to have been collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater risk of fraudulent activity existed., Where possible, similar dates and the type of aircraft were selected to allow for a comparative analysis of landing charges and passenger charges., An average price was then calculated for each type of aircraft by selecting a sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give an estimate of the total income from landing fees., The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication as to the respective costs for basic airport services, based on the weight of the aircraft., The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949 (equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a figure of €7,376,182 in the profit and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Accountants., This result suggests that in the absence of further information, the aircraft charges agreed with the figures produced in the official accounts of the Airport. However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot be verified. The possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely overcharged., It was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, certain airlines appeared to have measurably lower costs. These were: Airline 1 – Average DM 2190; Airline 2 – Average DM 2888., The receipts books do not indicate whether Airline 1 carried passengers and if so, how many., It was notable that where aircraft requested de-icing facilities, this appears to have added considerably to the landing fees costs., A schedule was created detailing costs associated with de-icing. With the possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this does not appear to indicate any obvious anomalies, although it again did not take into account the possibility that airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-icing., Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM per passenger. A spreadsheet was created detailing the total number of persons travelling in the period 1 February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January 2001., The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a total of 375,472 passengers during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not pay the required passenger tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and converted to Euro per paying passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as against a stated income figure in the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This gap is diminished if a number of passengers were to be added for the month of January 2001., However, there remains a possibility that the passengers were not being charged airport tax when they should have been, or that the sums detailed in the accounts do not equate with sums actually paid., In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the ITF sent a request to IATA to provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airline 5 and Airline 6 concerning any instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The request also sought information concerning any instances of corruption arising from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Airport., Regrettably, to date, no substantive response has been received from the airlines or IATA.]   \n",

complaint, ITF learned from the Airline Cargo Dept. that Pristina Airport had retroactively reduced its handling charges for outgoing mail to €0.12/kg and was no longer charging VAT., Pristina Airport staff confirmed this information and advised that the Invoice had been corrected and re-issued to the Airline., Furthermore, Pristina Airport staff advised that correct records of all financial transactions between Pristina Airport and the Airline relating to the invoices for April and subsequent months had been located., These assertions were confirmed in copies of corrected invoices and excerpts of the electronic financial records of Pristina Airport that were provided to ITF., ITF made the general observation that Pristina Airport’s mail handling invoices indicate that the entire invoiced amount is a 'tax payment'. This terminology, according to Pristina Airport staff, is incorrect as these amounts are handling fees that conform to established tariff rates.]   \n",

clerk of the UNDP Bratislava registry office and, in the normal course of business, forwarded by email to The Finance Department Supervisor, and to Finance Assistant 1., The Finance Department Supervisor then forwarded the genuine fax to the travel department for processing, but neither The Finance Department Supervisor nor Finance Assistant 1 forwarded the forged faxes elsewhere., Finance Assistant 1 then emailed 'The Consultant' on both occasions to notify him of the authorization of payment and he and 'The Consultant' exchanged emails to arrange the time and means of his collection of the payment., On both occasions 'The Consultant' presented himself at the UNDP office. On one occasion, he logged in with his signature and identification number, but there was no sign-in record the other time., 'The Consultant' met with someone from the finance department, probably Finance Assistant 1, although Finance Assistant 1 has no recollection of meeting him., In keeping with accepted practice within UNDP Bratislava and Slovakia as a whole, whoever met with 'The Consultant' had him write his name and identity details on the back of the respective checks., However, UNDP Bratislava does not keep an independent copy of such information., 'The Consultant' also signed a cash disbursement form and subsequently cashed both checks., ID/OIOS obtained copies of the checks from the bank and acquired the identity details from the back of the check., ID/OIOS consulted with the Slovakian police and found that neither 'The Consultant' nor his company were in their databases and the police concluded that the identity materials provided by him when he picked up the checks were likely to be false., ID/OIOS also found that the email account used by 'The Consultant' to arrange collection of the cheques at UNDP Bratislava had been discontinued., ID/OIOS examined copies of the forged faxes which had been retained in the UNDP Bratislava registry database., These copies had a header with UNON’s sender details, but unlike the UNDP Bratislava hard copies in the finance files and those which had been forwarded to UNON in October 2003, the registry copies also had a footer which reflected that they had actually been sent from a store which provides fax services in a shopping centre near the UNDP Bratislava office., Finance Assistant 1 claimed he had not noticed the footer on them., When ID/OIOS asked why the photocopies of the forged faxes in the UNDP finance file did not have the footer, he disclaimed responsibility for the photocopying., At the time of these incidents, two photocopying assistants had been working on an ad hoc basis at the finance office and had access to departmental files., Photocopying Assistant 1 was a relative of The Finance Department Supervisor, and Photocopying Assistant 2, was the daughter of Finance Assistant 2., Photocopying Assistant 2 assisted her father periodically without pay., OIOS was informed that the two assistants helped in the preparation of the end of month financial returns, which included retrieving documents from various files, copying them and returning them to the files., Photocopying Assistant 1 was working at the finance office at the relevant time period, but it has not been fully established when Photocopying Assistant 2 worked at the office., No timesheets were kept for either assistant., Review of procedures at UNON, UNEP Narobi and UNDP Bratislava in connection with payments of this sort showed that UNDP Bratislava relies on the authorizing signatures on the faxes and does not verify their authenticity with the agency., UNDP Bratislava maintains a sign-in sheet which requires a signature and identity information, but it was kept haphazardly at the time of these incidents., UNDP Bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of identity, which is recorded on the back of the cheque, and the payee signs the original cash disbursement voucher upon receipt of the cheque, but the finance office does not retain a copy of the payee’s proof of identification., UNDP Bratislava does not maintain a mail log., While procedures for reconciling accounts between UNON and UNDP were in place, UNON did not attempt to reconcile the August 2002 UNDP Bratislava account for more than a year after it was purportedly submitted., UNEP Narobi stated that it has had several problems with fraudulent payments by UNDP offices.]   \n",

The email was also addressed to Senator John Kerry and Senator Dodd of the United States Senate. The email had an attachment that was addressed to the Executive Secretary of ECA and highlighted allegations of sexual harassment and rape perpetrated by some senior officials of ECA within the ECA Complex. The title to the attachment was 'Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA'. The document was also copied to the Secretary-General, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and senior officials in the UN System.', ''Abebe's' complaint to the American Government was that the Executive Secretary, ECA had failed to take action against staff members who were alleged to have sexually harassed and raped ten women staff members of ECA. 'Abebe' was therefore asking the American Government to intervene on behalf of the aggrieved women.', 'The above email and the attachment were copied to the staff member and other persons working in the Organization.']}, {'title': 'Email submitted by the staff member to Ambassador Negroponte and US Government Officials', 'details': ['On 28 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email to His Excellency, Ambassador John Negroponte of the US Mission to the UN and 'Hiwot'.

In addition, he attached to the email the document alleging rape and sexual harassment by some officials of ECA - 'Crimes of Rape and Maladministration within the compound of ECA'. On the same day White House responded and thanked the staff member for emailing President Bush and Vice - President Cheney.', 'In his email to Ambassador Negroponte, the staff member informed him that the aggrieved staff members had exhausted all avenues available for recourse under the UN justice system. The staff member therefore appealed to Ambassador Negroponte to intervene by drawing this to the attention of the Secretary-General.']}, {'title': 'Interview of the staff member', 'details': ['In his interview with the Investigators, the staff member initially denied sending the email and the attachment in question to Ambassador Negroponte and other persons outside the UN System. Later he conceded that he wrote to the Ambassador in his capacity as a staff representative after the aggrieved staff members approached him for assistance.', 'The staff member stated that there were ten women staff members who were victims of sexual harassment at ECA. When the Investigators requested the staff member to provide the names of the ten women staff members, he refused to do so. He stated that he was actually told about the allegations by a Staff Union member who confided to him that the allegations were true. The staff member refused to disclose the name of the staff member to the Investigators.', 'When the staff member was asked why he sought assistance from Ambassador Negroponte, a non-UN staff member, his response was that the aggrieved staff members who were working as a group felt that the issue was taking a long time to resolve; therefore, he decided to appeal to Ambassador Negroponte. He said that he did not consult ECA management before writing to persons outside the Organization as the ECA internal justice system seemed to have collapsed. He said that his conscience was clear that sexual harassment did happen and that was why he had intervened on behalf of the female staff members.', 'The staff member stated that the sexual harassment issue was raised and addressed at several staff and management meetings by the Executive Secretary. In this connection, on 18 March 2003, the Executive Secretary wrote a memorandum to the Officer-in-Charge, OHRM responding to all the allegations leveled against the management of ECA. On the allegation of sexual harassment, the Executive Secretary concluded by stating that it was 'totally unfounded and simply ridiculous and preposterous'.']}, {'title': 'Emails by the staff member to Mr. Mzumara, OIC, SRO, Lusaka', 'details': ['On 29 January 2003, the staff member wrote an email to Mr. Dickson Mzumara, Officer-in-Charge of the ECA Sub Regional Office in Lusaka, Zambia confirming that he had written to Ambassador Negroponte because he had had a chat with friends who thought that 'this was too much of a hot potato'. Mr. Mzumara was also a recipient of a copy of the email that was addressed to Ambassador Negroponte by the staff member.', 'On the same day, Mr. Mzumara replied through an email to the staff member and concurred with his action of writing to the Ambassador. However, Mr. Mzumara pointed out to the staff member that he was concerned that he, the staff member, was writing to persons outside the Organization. Mr. Mzumara stated that 'Yes I thought as much. My concern was you were going out of the system and this is not in line with the Conditions of Service. See what comes out of it'. The staff member responded via email dated 29 January 2003 and stated that, 'Thanks that I have been told. This question was brought in the JAB in Nairobi. With a few phone calls, the case was shelved. The lady who broadcasted the message is the one who wrote to White House and the Vice Presidents of the USA. If the internal justice system had functioned everything would have been kept within the system. My hope was Negroponte being in the UN Secretariat would do damage control and get somehow the Boss to address the problem, in the best interest of the Secretary General. The ladies will continue writing to Human Rights Organizations, especially those that are fired. It may not produce immediate results but a lot of damage will be done'. He added that he wrote to the Ambassador 'to show the man that dialogue is the best option in life'.']}, {'title': 'Interview with Mr. Dickson Mzumara', 'details': ['Mr. Mzumara recalled that in January 2003, the concerned staff member who retired in November 2003 wrote to US Ambassador Negroponte concerning grievances of sexual harassment at ECA. He said that after he received a copy of that communication through email, he wrote to the staff member and advised him that it was contrary to UN Regulations for him to communicate with persons external to the Organization. In connection with this communication, Mr. Mzumara advised the staff member to tender a letter of resignation.']}, {'title': 'Allegations of Sexual Harassment', 'details': ['The allegation of sexual harassment made by one of the female staff members named in the anonymous letters was investigated by OIOS/ID. She had complained that her contract was terminated after she had turned down the sexual advances of a manager.', 'The female staff member informed OIOS that during an office retreat held at the Nazareth Restaurant in 2001, the manager was at the coffee shop with two other staff members, Mr. Oluwatete Olokodana, Deputy Chief of Security and Mr. Vintzislav Stokykov, Chief, Facilities Management Section, when the manager approached her saying, 'why are you wearing this, it’s too hot here'. Whilst saying this he put his hand on her T-shirt and tried to look and touch her breast.', 'When interviewed, Mr. Olokodana said that he did not witness any sexual harassment at the retreat. However, in the presence of Mr. Stoykov, he recalled that the female staff member complained to the manager that she was not feeling well whilst they were having lunch.', 'OIOS interviewed Mr. Stoykov who said that such an incident did not occur. However, he recalled the female staff member being in the company of the manager, Mr. Olokodana and himself when she came to complain that she had flu whilst they were having coffee.', 'The manager told OIOS that he did not sexually harass the female staff member and that such allegations are made when staff members are dissatisfied with certain managerial decisions. He said that the female staff member’s contract was terminated because her performance was poor.', 'When the female staff member was re-interviewed by ID/OIOS, she maintained that she had been sexually harassed. When asked why she had not engaged the various possible internal systems, including OHRMS to have the issue resolved, she stated that she had not pursued the issue because she did not know how to approach it. The female staff member explained that she thinks that her contract was not renewed because of the sexual harassment. The female staff member left the employment of ECA some two years ago and has never taken any steps to engage any United Nations system options to pursue her complaint.', 'In light of the above, there is therefore insufficient evidence to support the female staff member’s allegation of sexual harassment. Both Mr. Olokodana and Mr. Stoykov whom she claimed witnessed the incident deny that any incident occurred and reported a substantially different exchange.', 'Ms. Bongoy – Mawalla, Chief General Services Section explained to OIOS that she was the focal point for women until July 2003. She said that during her tenure, she issued a circular to create awareness about sexual harassment but no incident was reported by staff members.', 'During interviews with OIOS, Mr. Ali Todaro, Special Assistant to the Executive Secretary also denied sexually harassing women staff members at ECA as alleged in the anonymous emails. Because those women were not named and the staff member refused to identify them to ID/OIOS, it was not possible to further pursue the allegations.']}]   \n",

memorandum dated 19 January 2000, Official 3 asked the ACGD Officer to settle relevant claims and to provide supporting documentation for the US$49,000 the ACGD Officer had received for payment of DSA and other miscellaneous expenses at the conference., ID/OIOS Investigators observed that of the five PT.8 reference numbers referred to by Official 4 in his memorandum of 17 February 2000, one was repeated and another PT.8 had in fact not been cancelled, leaving three rather than five apparently inappropriately disbursed DSA payments in the amount of US$3,011.]   \n",

UNEP/PCAU Consultant maintained an ongoing relationship with their former company, thereby creating a conflict of interest., The evidence adduced for Allegation 2 does not support the complaint against UNEP Staff Member 1., The evidence adduced for allegation 3 shows that UNEP Staff Member 2 received an appointment with PCAU in May 2000, about a year after s/he began work for the BTF as a consultant., UNEP management advised ID/OIOS that UNEP Staff Member 1 and UNEP Staff Member 2 performed well, which they felt justified their decision to grant them contracts at the high level.,

                               [This case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at Pristina Airport arising from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in the period January – December 2001. The case also deals with allegations of corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times., Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in 2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact that fees appear to have been collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater risk of fraudulent activity existed., Where possible, similar dates and the type of aircraft were selected to allow for a comparative analysis of landing charges and passenger charges., An average price was then calculated for each type of aircraft by selecting a sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give an estimate of the total income from landing fees., The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication as to the respective costs for basic airport services, based on the weight of the aircraft., The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949 (equivalent to €7,341,163. This compares with a figure of €7,376,182 in the profit and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Accountants., This result suggests that in the absence of further information, the aircraft charges agreed with the figures produced in the official accounts of the Airport. However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot be verified. The possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely overcharged., It was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, certain airlines appeared to have measurably lower costs. These were: Airline 1 – Average DM 2190; Airline 2 – Average DM 2888., The receipts books do not indicate whether Airline 1 carried passengers and if so, how many., It was notable that where aircraft requested de-icing facilities, this appears to have added considerably to the landing fees costs., A schedule was created detailing costs associated with de-icing. With the possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this does not appear to indicate any obvious anomalies, although it again did not take into account the possibility that airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-icing., Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM per passenger. A spreadsheet was created detailing the total number of persons travelling in the period 1 February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January 2001., The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a total of 375,472 passengers during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not pay the required passenger tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and converted to Euro per paying passenger, this gives a total of €4,799,395 as against a stated income figure in the accounts of €4,919,190 for the whole year. This gap is diminished if a number of passengers were to be added for the month of January 2001., However, there remains a possibility that the passengers were not being charged airport tax when they should have been, or that the sums detailed in the accounts do not equate with sums actually paid., In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the ITF sent a request to IATA to provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airline 5 and Airline 6 concerning any instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The request also sought information concerning any instances of corruption arising from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Airport., Regrettably, to date, no substantive response has been received from the airlines or IATA.]   \n",

Airport representatives had contacted ICAA several times for such policy documents and felt uncomfortable canceling the old policy without comprehensive information about the new one., A KTA Internal Audit Department staff member confirmed that no breaches of KTA rules, UNMIK procurement rules, or the above-mentioned agreement could be identified in the purchase of the new policy through the ICAA., The ITF further concludes that UNMIK procurement rules were not applicable to the ICAA as the agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA is prevailing and does not identify such a requirement., There is also no evidence of improper collusion or negotiations during the requisitioning process of the insurance policy, nor is there evidence that the process was corrupted.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €180,816.00., Allegation 1: It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April 2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003. However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1 stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper description of the cabins in their bid documents. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender., Allegation 2: It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process. The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and 15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15 altogether., Second tender: A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her interview. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a bid. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2. There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national company. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria, came at a high price.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €774,318.63., Allegation 1: Specifically, the tender documents for the cargo apron did not comply with the requirements of Article 23.4 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, as they were based on summary documents and did not include clear instructions on drawings and plans., A note from the Project Engineer at the Evaluation Company to the PEAP Official, dated 31 January 2001, indicates that the Evaluation Company was commissioned to produce a preliminary design for the Cargo Terminal at Pristina Airport. The design also provided for the construction of the Cargo Apron Extension., A prequalification evaluation was held 5 April 2001 as a result of which five companies were pre-qualified to submit bids for the Cargo Apron Extension. Four companies submitted bids, and following an evaluation, the contract was awarded to the Vendor. A contract was signed for the Cargo Apron Extension on 11 September 2001., A letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 9 May 2001 indicates that it submitted a bid for the Cargo Apron Extension. The tender documents include what appears to be a section from the preliminary design documents produced by the Evaluation Company. Specifically, it includes a section entitled 'Bills of Quantities' from pages 17 and 18 of the Evaluation Company preliminary design documents., An interoffice memorandum providing an 'outstanding issues update to Official 2', from DOTI Official 3 to Staff member 1 at the office of Official 2 dated 18 May 2001, could give rise to the suggestion that offers were provided by companies on 28 May 2001, and the Vendor had been chosen for the works in advance. However, a more likely explanation is the date of the interoffice memorandum has been incorrectly dated, since the document contains reference dates relating to project 'events' which post date 18 May 2001. At paragraph 2b, the interoffice memorandum states that the Cargo Apron invitation to tender was based on summary documents., At paragraph 4 of the Cargo Apron Extension evaluation report dated 2 August 2001, the committee notes that the bidding documents did not include clear instructions on drawing and plans. It therefore was recommended that negotiations be held with the lowest bidder, the Vendor, on further details of the scope of works., In combination, the two documents suggest that the tender documents did not comply with Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds., When asked whether he/she was of the view that the tender documents complied with the provisions of Article 23.3 of the UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds, DOTI Official 2 conceded that if an engineer was asked this question, he/she would indicate that the tender specifications were technically deficient and did not comply with Article 23.3., DOTI Official 2 explained that the technical details of the Cargo Apron extension project were taken from the cargo terminal study produced by the Evaluation Company and pasted into the tender document specifications. Thereafter, it was up to the company winning the tender to demonstrate that they could fulfil the specification., According to DOTI Official 2, Airport Engineer 1, who arrived shortly after the tender had been launched, had been angry with the Evaluation Company for allowing DOTI Official 2 to send out excerpts of their study as the tender specifications. Airport Engineer 1 had also expressed concern at the method used for preparing the tender documents, as from an engineering point of view the tenders did not contain sufficient detail. However, DOTI Official 2 stated that if the Evaluation Company had been asked to prepare the tender documents, it would have cost more money. He/she had therefore prepared the tender documents himself/herself and sent them to a Procurement Official at the CPE to review and help him with the procurement exercise., Assistance from the CPE was provided primarily by a CPE Procurement Officer, and to a lesser extent by the Procurement Official, as to the procurement documents and rules. However, DOTI Official 2 expressed the view that neither the Procurement Official nor the CPE Procurement Officer would have had the technical expertise or time to review the technical specifications., DOTI Official 2 emphasised that there was no engineering expert to support his/her work at the time the tender was launched, a fact that made his/her work very difficult., Allegations 2 & 3: Specifically, three of the persons on the bid opening committee and evaluation committees were the same parties who should not have carried out both tasks and the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., The evaluation report dated 2 August 2001 is signed by three parties, who are also listed as having attended the bid opening session. This indicates that the composition of the bid opening committee and the evaluation committee overlapped., When asked about this issue in interview DOTI Official 2 confirmed that he/she was both on the bid opening committee and was a member of the evaluation committee. He/she added that the people who evaluated the offers signed the evaluation report. This is in conflict with UN regulations, which segregate the two roles. An interoffice memorandum dated 24 September 2001 indicates that the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension had not been channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., Allegation 4: Specifically, that the Vendor produced its own test results to confirm the quality of its own work on the Cargo Apron, resulting in a conflict of interest., An interoffice memorandum from Staff member 2 to the Procurement Official, signed by DOTI Official 1 dated 18 October 2001, indicates that DOTI Official 1 authorised the soil stabilisation work. The memorandum also adds that the work was inadvertently not included in the original contract., DOTI Official 2 told the ITF that in order to progress the cargo apron tender, he/she had to organise a geographical survey. He/she added that only after the tests were done could the tender go ahead. However, the evaluation report at paragraph 4 suggests that information on the nature of the ground does not appear to have been included in the tender documents. In addition, a letter from the Vendor to UNMIK and PEAP dated 27 June 2001, but apparently not received at UNMIK and PEAP until 17 October 2001, according to a manuscript note signed by Airport Engineer 1 at the bottom of the letter, suggests that it carried out its own soil tests., A letter from the Vendor to PEAP dated 18 September 2003 suggests that the Vendor also produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby 'self certifying' its own work. Whilst the tender documents at page 5, reference 11.4, provide for the Contractor to pay liquidated damages in the event that the 'load-bearing' capacity of the apron is less than foreseen in the contract, upon completion of the work, the contract is silent as to whom should carry out the tests. However, it is questionable as to whether the Vendor should have carried it out, since it presents a conflict of interest., When asked about this in interview, the Divisional Manager stated: 'Without seeing any other documents, on the face of it, it does appear that there could be a conflict of interest here. But the report was produced by a professional pavement engineer, at a laboratory. Therefore, one can assume a certain degree of integrity.', The ITF notes that the PEAP Official indicated that he/she was unhappy about the Vendor self-certifying its work and he/she commented that the airport engineer should have questioned it., The ITF does not have sufficient technical knowledge to assess the adequacy of the Vendor’s work. However, a letter from the Divisional Manager to Staff Member 3 dated 25 August 2002 gives rise to the possibility that it was not up to specification in certain areas.]   \n",

  [Although Vendor 2 Representative was never employed by the Airport the procurement file for the FIDS supply contains two notes with regard to recommendation and justification for the FIDS purchase dated both on 17 October 2002 and signed by Vendor 2 Representative. One note appears on white paper, the other one on Airport headed notepaper., The interviews of Vendor 2 Representative were conducted on 31 August 2004 and 14 September 2004. Vendor 2 Representative stated that he/she was probably asked by a PEAP Official to write a recommendation and justification note for the FIDS purchase. Vendor 2 at that time worked at the Airport for another project linked to the FIDS. Vendor 2 was sub-contractor of Vendor 3 working at the Expansion of the Terminal Building and observing the need for more FIDS., Vendor 2 Representative also stated that he/she with his/her company provided the Airport procurement office with technical specifications for the FIDS cabling on request by the PEAP Official. Vendor 2 Representative admitted that his/her involvement in the preparation of the FIDS supply and cabling procurements and the later participation in the FIDS cabling tender by his/her company put other competitors at a disadvantage. To prepare technical specifications for a tender and to take part in the same was according to Vendor 2 Representative common practice before the war., During his/her interview on 9 September 2004 the PEAP official gave contradictory statements with regard to his/her involvement in this case such as he/she probably had a meeting with Vendor 2 Representative and the PEAP Engineer to discuss the FIDS supply and as one result Vendor 2 Representative wrote the appropriate recommendation and justification note, but elsewhere he/she denied to have ordered Vendor 2 Representative to do so., The Airport Engineer was interviewed on 11 October 2004, as he/she is the responsible person to suggest new projects to the Airport Management. The Airport Engineer stated that he/she was at no time involved in the FIDS purchase and did not request the support by Vendor 2 Representative with regard to recommend and justify the FIDS supply. The Airport Engineer only recommended the cabling of the FIDS in a note to the Airport Management; all following procedures are under the responsibility of the procurement unit and the management., The Sales Manager of Vendor 1 was interviewed on the phone on 30 August 2004. Asked why Vendor 1 did not provide with the cabling of the FIDS he/she stated that Vendor 1’s management did not allow traveling to Kosovo at that time for security reasons. The Sales Manager of Vendor 1 also mentioned that the Airport's contact person with regard to the FIDS cabling was for him/her Vendor 2 Representative.]   \n",

    [ITF Investigators obtained a number of documents from Pristina Airport officials including records of funds received from the Airline for the period January to June 2004., These funds are broken down into handling, landing, airport passenger, and departure tax., The schedule also lists the individual Airport receipt number recorded for each cash payment., There was no record of the Airline having paid airport tax., ITF Investigators spoke to both Official 1 and Official 2 of the Airline and requested copies of receipts issued by Pristina Airport in respect of fees paid by the Airline to the airport, as well as the Aircraft 'Load Sheets' for May and June 2004., These documents record details such as the weight of the aircraft including the MTOW (maximum take off weight)., Airline Official 1 explained that the Airline paid cash for handling and landing charges to the Pristina Airport Passenger Handling Services Department on each occasion his aircraft used the airport., Airline Official 1 explained that he/she had endeavored to open a credit account with Pristina Airport, but without success., The ITF sought the assistance of the Security Officer at Pristina Airport, in order to monitor Airline passenger movements., On 22 July 2004, ITF Investigators monitored the Airline’s inward and outward flights and related airport activities., It was noted that whilst the arriving Kosovar passengers went through immigration procedures before entering into the arrivals lounge, the 25 security escorts and the representative of the related Immigration Department remained airside at all times awaiting instructions to return to the aircraft., They did not enter the terminal building., Other passengers departing with the Airline met in the Airport public lounge., Their identities were checked against a list provided by an UNMIK CIVPOL officer in consultation with the Immigration representative., They then went through conventional immigration and X-Ray searches and were escorted into the departure lounge before boarding the Airline aircraft., They did not, however, pass through regular check-in procedures at any time., ITF Investigators reviewed all paperwork relating to this flight., An Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport, provided the receipt book used to evidence cash payments for landing, handling and airport passenger taxes., It was noted that other airlines, particularly those not visiting Pristina on a regular basis, pay in cash for handling services., Details shown on the records provided by Pristina Airport officials were reconciled with this receipt book., The dates, amounts and breakdown of charges were confirmed., The pilot is required to sign the receipt book, and the ITF verified the recorded signature against the Airline 'Load Sheets' as genuine., The charges themselves, as calculated by the Airport Handling Services Department for Airline flights, were scrutinized against the published 'Price List for Basic Airport Services' issued on 1 January 2002., Details recorded on the 'Load Sheets' confirmed the handling charge of 1074 Euros was also found to be correct., The landing charge of €676.44 was, however, reduced by 50% as this flight was identified as a 'humanitarian flight' and as such qualified for the discount., The Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport told the ITF Investigators that she regarded the returning Kosovars as refugees and the discount as appropriate., The ITF Investigators checked this matter with the Official of the Airport General Services, who confirmed he/she was aware of this discount and did not dispute this interpretation of the flight., ITF Investigators asked the Official of the Passenger Handling Services, Pristina Airport to describe the airport tax obligations for such flights., The Official stated that the tax of €15 per passenger is payable in respect of departing passengers only., The Official explained that this tax is normally collected by the airlines using the check-in facilities as part of normal boarding procedures., He/She explained that the security guards and U.K. Immigration staff who remained airside awaiting return to the UK had not technically entered the Airport and as such were not liable for airport taxes., In respect of the other departing passengers, the Official said there was no obligation for the payment of this tax because neither the carrier nor the passengers used the regular check-in facilities of the Airport., The ITF reviewed the conventional check-in procedures at the Pristina Airport and confirmed they complied with observations provided by the Senior Official of the Pristina Airport in response to a Management Letter dated May 2004 on the 2003 Financial Audit from auditing company., An extract of the advice states the following: 'Passenger Fees OBSERVATION In the process of modernization of the Airport, Entity has acquired and implemented a so-called automatic checking system.', This system provides accurate evidence of passengers’ arriving and departure., However, PA has still not integrated and/or connected the automatic checking system with financial reporting., Establishment of an integrated system could provide efficient monitoring controls and accurate evidence, completeness and reconciliation of the number of passenger recorded by the automatic checking system and the revenue from passenger fees in the financial statement., Management Comment: Full integration will be achieved by the new system., At present, passenger and baggage check-in and boarding is automatically connected to the load sheet., The load sheet contains all relevant facts concerning the flight, including type and quantity of passengers., This report is signed by Airport load control staff, compared to a head-count on board the aircraft conducted by aircraft staff and is thereafter signed by the pilot before take-off., A copy of this confirmed report is used as a basis for invoicing., We use the information that later will be retrieved automatically by the new system., The possible loss of revenue of departing passenger taxes is another matter requiring attention from airport management.]   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [Analysis of the note written by the PEAP Official suggests that the company referred to in his note as 'escavator' is in fact Company 1, who won the contract for the construction of the new car park at Pristina Airport and whose representative attended a meeting in the PEAP Official’s office one day prior to the discovery of the money., The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a 'round sum' such as €5000., It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of bids., The KTA Procurement Specialist told the ITF that a meeting had been held in the PEAP Official’s office with Company 1, attended by the Company 1 Representative and a Company 1 engineer., The purpose of the meeting had been to hand the contract for the new car park to Company 1 and the Company 1 Representative to sign it., The KTA Procurement Specialist indicated that there were three or four other persons present, two of whom, he/she thought may be two staff members of Pristina Airport., The KTA Procurement Specialist added that it was normal practice for the party winning the bid to be invited to sign the contract in this way., The KTA Procurement Specialist also indicated that he/she did not see anything placed in the PEAP Official’s office or diary, although he/she later heard about the incident., He/she expressed his/her opinion that the incident had been arranged to 'break up' the contract with Company 1, but did not indicate by whom., The ITF reviewed the letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK Police Officer, which indicates that the matter was referred to the UNMIK police on 11 October 2002., The letter also records that the sum of €5,200 was handed to the UNMIK Police Officer., The UNMIK Police Officer, who is now based in Iraq, told the ITF that he/she served in Kosovo between June 2001 and November 2002 and recalls the incident being reported., He/she stated that at that time he/she was serving with the Border Police Investigations Unit and had assigned this enquiry to his then supervisor., The latter was unable to be interviewed as he/she had left the Mission., ITF investigators visited the Border Boundary Police and interviewed two current investigators., Neither officer recalled the incident, but they made extensive enquiries in an attempt to trace the police report and locate the €5,200., They were unsuccessful on both counts., On 27 September 2004, the ITF sent a letter to UNMIK Police Officer 2, in an effort to determine what investigations had been undertaken into the matter, the result of those investigations and the whereabouts of the money., The UNMIK Police Officer 2 indicated that Regional Crime Squad Pristina Region was undertaking an investigation into the matter, which therefore, remains an open investigation., The ITF then contacted the Regional Crime Squad and meetings were held with two officials., The ITF obtained a draft of the assigned officer’s report into the case, which indicates that the case had been opened in 2004., The two-page report indicates that the assigned officer had interviewed the PEAP Official, who had indicated that he/she did not understand why the envelope would have been left in his office, as he/she had no responsibility for the car park contract., The PEAP Official also stated that he/she had contacted the Company 1 Representative, who denied any knowledge of the envelope., The report also indicates that statements are to be taken from the Company 1 Representative and from the KTA Procurement Specialist., The Company 1 Representative was not interviewed by the ITF due to his role as a witness in an ongoing police investigation and any investigative activity by the ITF may have impacted upon that judicial inquiry., The ITF has also been informed that the €5,200, which is the subject of the attempted bribery case, is still missing and a police inquiry has commenced into its disappearance.]   \n",

These goods were imported from Beirut and were accompanied by an Air Waybill., The Company Representative was advised by Partner 2 of the consignment’s arrival. Partner 2 was also the person that handed over the Air Waybill to the Company Representative., At the time the consignment arrived in Kosovo, the Company did not have permission to erect the LED screen on any city building for advertisement purposes as they had intended. This authorization was granted sometime later, circa March/April 2004., The merchandise in question was paid for and cleared on the 15th of March 2004, by the nominated Shipping Agent. The same Agent, on behalf of the Company, paid a total amount of €11,581.00, VAT and Customs Duties included., Once all the payments had been effected, the Company Representative went to the Cargo Building to pick up his goods, but according to his statements, he/she was approached by Official 1, who advised the Company Representative that he/she was now required to pay the amount of €32,800.00 that included a storage charge for the period 26 December 2003 to 15 March 2004., Partner 2 was astonished at this excessive charge for storage. At this point, the Company management agreed to leave the goods in storage and decide on what action to take. They identified the possibility of returning the goods to their place of origin, due to the fact that the storage would have cost them nearly as much as the price of the screen (US$54,000.00)., Official 1 then advised the Company Representative that he would do everything in his/her power to assist in settling this situation, including an offer to lower the storage charge. Sometime thereafter, Official 1 advised the Company Representative that he/she was able to decrease the storage charge to €8,000.00 based on his/her position and connections at the Airport., The Company management accepted the new offer and agreed to pay the lower storage charge of €8,000.00. However, due to the fact that Partner 1 did not have €8,000.00 in cash, he/she commenced a search amongst his/her friends for the money. Subsequently, Partner 1 was able to raise the money to pay both the Custom Excise and Airport Storage fees., On the 16th of March 2004, Partner 1 paid the €8,000.00 to the Company Representative, who then went to Pristina Airport to hand it to Official 1. The Company Representative stated that the hand-over of the cash to Official 1 took place outside the airport terminal gate. The Airport X-Ray Operator, who observed the meeting between the two men, corroborated the fact that the meeting took place as stated., ITF Investigators visited the Cargo Department Finance Office to check official documentation in relation to the Company merchandise. No trace of the payment of the €8,000 could be found in the Cargo Department account books for 2003 or 2004., According to the tariff list that the Finance Officer of the Cargo Section provided to the ITF, the Company should have paid an amount of approximately €32,000.00 for storage fees from the 23rd of December 2003 to 15th of March 2004., In view of the above, ITF Investigators interviewed Official 2 who offered no justifiable explanation as to why no payment had been effected with respect to the Company goods. He/she simply repeated that the goods were confiscated from the Customs Service and that just a minor payment of storage fees should have occurred. Unfortunately, no trace of payment (current official storage price list payment or the minor payment that Official 2 declared in his/her official interview) was detected by the ITF nor provided by Official 2. Further inquiries carried out by the ITF on 6 July 2004 at Pristina Airport Customs Offices and at Pristina Customs Services Headquarters, disclosed that the merchandise did indeed enter the airport storage on 26 December 2003 and left on 15 March 2004. According to two staff members, the Company merchandise was not confiscated based on a request from Customs. The ITF found that the Company paid a total amount of €11,581.00 for VAT and Customs Duties., On July 12th 2004, ITF Investigators interviewed Partner 4 confirmed that the first requested amount was €32,000.00, which was later changed to the agreed sum of €8,000.00. He/she added that he/she received a strange phone call from a staff member of Airline 2 Pristina Office on 9 July 2004, advising him/her to urgently make contact with Official 2 on his/her mobile telephone, because Official 2 urgently needed to speak with Partner 4. According to Partner 4’s statement, he/she called Official 2, who asked for an appointment in order to discuss 'a certain issue'. Partner 4 said he/she replied that there was no need to continue this conversation, as he/she knew that Official 2 was trying to influence any statements by Partner 4 that he/she may provide to any future inquiries from an investigative body. Partner 4 stated to the ITF that he/she advised the staff member of Airline 2 of his already scheduled appointment with ITF Investigators on the following Monday and that he/she was prepared to tell all he knew on the matter. In view of all the collected data and evidence, the ITF decided to refer the case to the Department of Justice.]   \n",

                                                                                     [The ITF Investigators established that on 13 and 20 July 2001, UNMIK and the Company signed a contract 'Relating to the Supply of Aviation Fuel and the Refuelling of Commercial Civilian Aircraft at Pristina Airport'. As of 03 March 2004, this Contract was amended, so that the Company also commenced supplying aviation fuel and refuelling services to military and non-commercial aircrafts., Based on this contract, the Company has been making payments to UNMIK that are being deposited to an UNMIK Bank Subject Account, opened at a Bank in Pristina. This is a sub-account of the main UNMIK Bank Account., The Bank Account was opened with the Bank on 11 October 2001 and the first payment was made by way of an incoming International Money Transfer (IMT) in the sum of € 45,105.23 on 17 April 2002. The most recent payment made to this account was made on 24 January 2005 by the Company in the sum of € 8,578.42. The actual balance on this bank account as of 04 March 2005 is € 537,536.90., Initially Staff Member 1, was the 'A' signatory of this account. On 14 July 2004, his/her Supervisor, formally notified Staff Member 2, that he/she was an 'A' signatory to this account with Staff Member 3 and Staff Member 4 being 'B' signatories. Staff Member 2 was also notified that withdrawals from this account could not be made without the joint approval of either the Supervisor, Staff Member 5 or Staff Member 6. Staff Member 2 was also informed that the Account was currently an UNMIK Bank Account and that Pristina Airport did not have full control over the use of this account., The ITF Investigators found no evidence that funds deposited in this UNMIK Bank Account were generated by illegal activities. In fact this investigation confirmed that all funds deposited on this account were generated by a legitimate business sanctioned by a contract between UNMIK and the Company., The allegation that had been made by the Chartered Accountants - 'interest from this account was going to an unidentified private account' was found to be without merit, given that the terms and conditions this UNMIK Bank Account does not generate any interest. The ITF Investigators further established that there were no withdrawals from this Account; the only debits were a variety of bank charges., The ITF Investigation identified a long running dispute related to the legal ownership of the money deposited to this UNMIK Bank Account. The funds deposited to this account are being generated exclusively from the Pristina Airport through a contract between UNMIK and Air BP. Despite numerous inquiries that have been made by the Pristina Airport General Services Department, no definitive answer has been provided as to who is the owner of this money. As a result, a sum of € 537,536.90 is 'sitting' in this UNMIK Account and it does not generate any interest payments. It should be noted that the Pristina Airport now has to borrow money to run its day-to-day operations. This situation would suggest that the UNMIK Senior Management team should resolve the legal ownership question as soon as possible.]   \n",

                                              [Prior to travelling to Liberia to investigate the allegations against Officer 1, ID/OIOS reviewed the IAD1/OIOS audit report. Amongst other matters raised in the report, IAD1/OIOS noted that, for the period 1 August 2003 to 31 March 2004, 290,066 gallons of fuel (valued at US$455,404) could not be accounted for. The Auditors noted that there had been an investigation by UNMIL’s Special Investigation Unit (SIU) into allegations that UNMIL fuel was being sold by bowser drivers to third parties and that the investigation had concluded that there was credible evidence against some of the bowser drivers and their supervisor. As a result of the investigation, the supervisor and the drivers involved were dismissed. Since the supervisor in question was the one responsible for the monitoring of deliveries and the completion of bowser log sheets, IAD1/OIOS concluded that 'irregularities in the distribution' could account for the 290,066-gallon discrepancy., The IAD/OIOS Auditors made a total of 17 recommendations to UNMIL regarding the way that the mission managed fuel. The mission accepted all but one of the recommendations (this recommendation was subsequently withdrawn by IAD-1/OIOS) and has implemented them., Upon receipt of information on 13 March 2004 that UNMIL bowser drivers were selling UNMIL fuel to local vendors in Monrovia and other parts of Liberia, the SIU initiated an investigation into the allegations. The SIU investigation revealed that some locally hired drivers, employed to deliver fuel to various UNMIL installations, were selling a portion of the fuel they were transporting to local vendors. The SIU found that the theft and sale of UNMIL fuel was organised by the drivers’ supervisor and that it had begun soon after the mission commenced in 2003. As a result of the investigation, the supervisor and the drivers identified by the SIU were dismissed. There was no evidence disclosed during the SIU investigation to suggest that Officer 1 was in any way involved in the theft and subsequent re-sale of the fuel., The original complainant in the case was interviewed by ID/OIOS. He stated that he had no personal knowledge of either the problems with the Fuel Cell accounts or of any involvement of Officer 1 in the problems identified. He claimed that he had become aware, as a result of his position in the mission, that an audit was being conducted into the Fuel Cell accounts and that an amount of approximately US$500,000 could not be accounted for. This was the information that he had communicated to ID/OIOS, along with the fact that Officer 1 was an Officer of the Fuel Cell at the time.

request from ID/OIOS, UNICEF Management agreed to cooperate with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing access to its files and staff members involved in the fraud. However, UNICEF Management insisted, and ID/OIOS agreed, that ID/OIOS interviews of their staff be conducted at UNICEF premises and in the presence of two Senior UNICEF Managers. The objectives of these interviews by ID/OIOS were to confirm and/or rule out involvement by UNON staff members in similar cases and to obtain information to ensure that UNON management safeguard mechanisms to avoid similar occurrences at UNON., ID/OIOS could not interview all UNICEF staff or former staff involved in the fraud. For example, one staff member passed away and another, who had left UNICEF, declined the interview. In addition, the UNICEF inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the interviews of UNICEF staff by ID/OIOS suggested that there might be more UNICEF staff involved than initially envisaged., During their interviews with ID/OIOS, the concerned UNICEF staff confirmed that they misused UNICEF letterhead and official seal, indicated that they forged the signature of a UNICEF Operations officer and that they provided UN-SACCO with incorrect information about the duration of their contracts in order to obtain loans. All of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers, although given the limited responsibilities of some of them, for example, the drivers, such access should not have occurred., Further, most interviewees stated that they acted alone and, with one exception, all denied that either their UNICEF or UNON colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise aware of or involved in such improper actions., UN-SACCO and UNON staff members interviewed by the ID/OIOS Investigators provided general information about their operations and otherwise cooperated with the ID/OIOS inquiry by providing unhindered access to their files. However, these interviews did not produce conclusive information to either suggest or completely rule out improper conduct on the part of UNON staff members., Documentation obtained from UN-SACCO shows that about 2,500 staff members from UNON and other United Nations related organizations have requested and obtained UN-SACCO loans, about one thousand of whom are UNON staff. Given the large number of records to review, which would then need to be compared to similar records from UNON, and the absence of any identified subjects, the ID/OIOS Investigators decided to do a thorough review of a sampling of cases. Files were selected for review where the loan amount was high, the duration of the contract long, or the applicant was also a guarantor on other loans., Further, whenever the ID/OIOS Investigators noted apparent irregularities concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff to UN-SACCO, for example letters suggesting that their contracts would be renewed beyond the expiration date of their contracts, the ID/OIOS officers made copies of those documents and compared them with the corresponding documentation available in the Official Status Files of those staff and/or confirmed with UNON officials whose signatures appeared on those letters that they had indeed signed them., The ID/OIOS Investigators noted with concern that in January 2005, one Senior UNEP Manager had informed UN-SACCO management that the contract of a particular staff member is likely to be extended for a further two years, subject to satisfactory performance. During the manager’s interview with ID/OIOS, s/he admitted s/he had written a letter at the request of the staff member and advised that such letters are sometimes provided to UN-SACCO so that locally recruited staff can obtain loans. ID/OIOS cautions managers that the issuance of these letters may give the impression that a staff member’s contract will be renewed., In this regard, it should be noted that most, if not all letters of appointments issued by the Organization, provide that fixed-term appointments do not carry any expectation of renewal or of conversion to any other type of appointment and expire automatically and without prior notice on the expiration date specified in the letter of appointment., This position is consistent with the jurisprudence of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal (UNAT), which has established that good performance by a staff member does not by itself create any legitimate expectation for renewal of any fixed-term contract.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €180,816.00., Allegation 1: (It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender). A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April 2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003. However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1 stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper description of the cabins in their bid documents. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender., Allegation 2: (It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process). The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and 15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15 altogether., Second tender: A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her interview. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a bid. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2. There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national company. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria, came at a high price.]   \n",

The value of the contract was €180,816.00., Allegation 1: It is alleged that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender. A bid evaluation report drawn up by the Procurement Officer, dated 18 April 2003, identifies that bids were opened in an evaluation process to select a company to supply cleaning machines to Pristina Airport on 18 April 2003. However, a notification letter from the PEAP Official and the KTA Divisional Manager to the companies participating in the tender exercise dated 6 June 2003 confirms that this tender was cancelled. When asked about the reason for the cancellation, the Procurement Officer 1 stated to the ITF that the technical specifications for the first tender were taken from a catalogue of a certain producer, which offered those machines, as a result of which it predetermined the winner. He/she added that machinery specified was of the most expensive type. The Maintenance Official and Member of the Evaluation Committee, when asked the same question, stated that the first tender was cancelled due to the fact that the Procurement Officer 1 indicated there had been no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines in the bids submitted. However, he/she added that from his/her knowledge at least two of the companies had included a proper description of the cabins in their bid documents. An Engineer at the Pristina Airport, told the ITF that the Airport requested cleaning machines with cabins in order that cleaning could be carried out in different weather conditions. However, the bidders did not include the cabin in their bids. In the light of the evidence provided, and detailed below, the ITF does not find that the first tender was irregularly cancelled due to the fact that no proper description of the cabins for the cleaning machines was included by companies submitting bids in the first tender., Allegation 2: It is alleged that tender specifications for both tenders the cleaning machines were taken from the brochure of one of the companies submitting a tender, thereby giving it an unfair advantage in the tender process. The person responsible for drawing up the specifications for the both tenders was the Engineer at the Pristina Airport, who confirmed in interview that he/she had been asked to draw up the specifications by the Member of the Evaluation Committee. He/she also confirmed that the Member of the Evaluation Committee provided him with signed photocopies from the brochure of Vendor 1 in order to assist him in drawing up the specifications. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport added that he/she used them as a basis for the technical specifications. The ITF located a draft of an undated handwritten note from the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to the KTA Divisional Manager, which confirms that he/she used the photocopies from the brochure to assist him in drawing up the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Member of the Evaluation Committee confirmed to the ITF that he/she handed the signed pages to the Engineer at the Pristina Airport to assist in the preparation of the technical specifications for the cleaning machines. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport and the Member of the Evaluation Committee were asked in interview whether they were aware of the provision of Article 15 of Financial Administration Instruction No. 2/1999, and in particular Articles 15.1 and 15.4. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport indicated that he/she worked on the general principle set out in Article 15.1, but had not seen Article 15.4; whilst the Chairman of the Evaluation Committee appeared to be ignorant of Article 15 altogether., Second tender: A bid evaluation report dated 30 June 2003 indicates that a second tender exercise was undertaken following the cancellation of the first one. Pristina Airport Procurement Officer 2 in the second tender indicated that although Procurement Officer 1 published the tender, Procurement Officer 2 did the bid opening and was the Member of the Evaluation Committee. This is confirmed in a memorandum from Procurement Officer 2 to the PEAP Official dated 9 July 2003, which identifies the evaluation committee members and in an ITF interview with Procurement Officer 2, the PEAP Official did not refer to Procurement Officer 2 or the second tender evaluation committee in his/her interview. Procurement Officer 2 added that the evaluation committee chose Vendor 2. However, after he/she had drafted the contract and letter of acceptance for signature, he/she was instructed by the Airport management, although he/she did not state by whom, to put it on hold until the technical evaluation committee and airport management had organised a meeting with the Procurement Officer 1. According to Procurement Officer 2, the reason for the meeting was due to concerns that the winning bid was the second most expensive and doubts that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company. An examination of the technical evaluation report and Vendor 2’s bid documentation suggests that the specification produced by Vendor 2 was very similar to the specification requirement, although there is no evidence that it was provided with the technical specifications in advance. In addition, Vendor 1, the company from whose brochure the specifications were taken, did not submit a bid. An Internet search indicates Vendor 1 is the second largest producer of industrial cleaning machines in one United Nations member state being founded in 1966. It went into insolvency in 2002 and was bought by a multi-national company. An Internet search of its directors does not indicate any connection with Vendor 2. There is also no indication that Vendor 2 is connected to the multi-national company. The Engineer at the Pristina Airport, in interview with the ITF, also stated that the evaluation committee had raised doubts as to whether it would be worthwhile purchasing the cleaning machines, which whilst meeting the specification criteria, came at a high price.]   \n",

      "1   [Whilst noting the comments in the capital expenditure approval that Vendor 3 was the only company that can provide the quality of uniforms needed within the time limit, it is of concern that Vendor 3’s offer for winter uniforms in the sum of €157,060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from Vendor 1 (€80,198) and Vendor 2 (€86,850). However, this may in part be due to the fact that the Vendor 2 submitted an offer that did not contain all the required articles, whilst Vendor 1 produced uniforms of lower quality., The only original bid documents seen by the ITF relating to the tender for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenance personnel for the winter season is the bid submitted by Vendor 3. Therefore, the ITF is unable to verify the findings of the evaluation committee resulting in the rejection of the bids submitted by the two other companies., Evidence as to whether or not capital expenditure was or was not obtained prior to signature of the contract is inconclusive, since the date on the contract, (6 December 2002) is contradicted by the routing slip dated 13 January 2003, which suggests that the letter of notification and contract may not have been signed until after 10 January 2003. The benefit of the doubt must therefore be given to the Divisional Manager in this respect., The offer received from Vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms (€24,997) was €3 below the maximum limit for competitive shopping of €25,000. This raises concerns as to whether a competitive tender should have been held rather than competitive shopping procedure., Whilst there are some doubts as to the quality of uniforms produced by Vendor 1, the selection of Vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region. The ITF does not therefore find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such a manner as to provide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier Vendor 3., The evidence that companies submitting bids were irregularly requested to provide different quantities of items is not proven in the light of the response given in interview by the Procurement Officer., In spite of the explanation given by the PEAP Official, evidence from the Security Official indicates that the two small orders for T-shirts were placed at a value of €1188 and €792, in order to avoid having to organise a competitive shopping procedure, since the limit for single source procurements at that time was €1250. It is likely that this was a conscious decision and constitutes a breach of Article 24 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds.]   \n",

This is again contrary to Article 8.2 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds., In addition, the Divisional Manager authorised the Annex Agreement to proceed in spite of the fact that the contract exceeded his/her authorisation limit of €25,000 to sign and approve a contract which deviated from the normal procurement procedure under Article 6.3 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Fund., Evidence indicates that the Divisional Manager failed to secure funding approval prior to authorising expenditure for the annex agreement to construct a fire-fighters office and maintenance offices.

This gave rise to concerns that the technical specifications had given an unfair advantage to one company in breach of Article 15.1 of UNMIK Finance Administrative Instruction 1999/2 on Public Procurement using Kosovo Consolidated Budget Funds., The reasons for the second tender not proceeding appear to be well founded if concerns were expressed over the offer price and the technical specification. However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether in this instance, the use of technical specifications from a particular company brochure was a deliberate attempt to corrupt the tender process or due to ignorance of the regulations.]   \n",

This appears to have been due to an attempt to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately qualified staff., In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender documents also appears to have been due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the tender documents rather than a deliberate act calculated to manipulate the tender process., DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the tender documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE must also bear a certain amount of responsibility., The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result., Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations., Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby 'self certifying' its own work and presenting a potential conflict of interest.]   \n",

This appears to have been due to an attempt to cut costs in preparing the tender documents, as well as a lack of appropriately qualified staff., In mitigation, the inadequacy of the tender documents also appears to have been due to ignorance as to the appropriate quantity of detail to be included in the tender documents rather than a deliberate act calculated to manipulate the tender process., DOTI Official 2 is primarily responsible for the shortcomings in the tender documents although, DOTI Official 1 and the CPE must also bear a certain amount of responsibility., The shortcomings in the tender documents are likely to have prejudiced some companies in their decision as to submitting bids for the tenders, since they may not have been clear as to the detailed requirements of the tender and therefore submitted insufficient detail in their bids as a result., Three persons are indicated to have both attended the bid opening session as well as been on the tender evaluation committee, in conflict with UN regulations., Evidence indicates the contract for the Cargo Apron Extension was not channelled through the Office of the Legal Adviser., Evidence indicates that the Vendor produced its own bearing capacity report for the Cargo Apron, thereby 'self certifying' its own work and presenting a potential conflict of interest.]   \n",

The excuse by Vendor 2 Representative that such an involvement was common practice before the war has nowadays definitely lost its validity., It has to be assumed that Vendor 2 won the FIDS cabling tender only due to the fact that the company was definitely in advantage with regard to advanced knowledge of the technical requirements and had therefore sufficient time to prepare a good bid in terms of the price., Although PEAP Official as the responsible official at that time denied that he/she had requested Vendor 2 Representative support for the FIDS supply and cabling procurements, Vendor 2 Representative granted the ITF that he/she acted on PEAP Official’s request., Nevertheless, PEAP official bears the overall responsibility for his/her department (PEAP), and this investigation proved again that he/she did not fully meet the requirements as manager in a sensitive area like the Airport., The entire matter has to be seen as an administrative irregularity. It is obvious that international procurement rules had been breached but the Procurement Regulation that was in force at that time - Financial Agreement 1999/2 - does not indicate cases like described before., Furthermore, to prove a possible case of corruption, there are not enough indications.]   \n",

The ITF investigation clearly proved that the funds deposited on this Subject UNMIK Bank Account were generated by a legitimate business sanctioned by a valid contract between UNMIK and the Air BP. None of the deposited money has been withdrawn and the only debits to this account were a variety of bank charges., The ITF did not find evidence that would indicate any illegalities related to this UNMIK Bank Account. Staff Member 1 was an 'A' signatory to this Account as well to a number of other UNMIK Bank Accounts. Upon his/her departure from Kosovo, the right of 'A' signatory for this account (and other UNMIK Bank Accounts) was formally transferred to other authorised individuals., The ITF Investigation identified a long lasting problem related to legal ownership of the funds deposited in this UNMIK Bank Account that should be addressed and resolved as soon as possible.]   \n",

Moreover, these interviews also suggested possible improper conduct by one UNICEF manager, who may have contributed to the fraud by providing a letter, which suggested that the contract of one staff would be extended further beyond its normal term., The review of likely candidates for such frauds (i.e., those with large loans and long contracts) did not produce a single instance of fraud. However, ID/OIOS cannot exclude the possibility that locally recruited UNON staff members have submitted fraudulent letters to UN-SACCO to obtain loans, as had their UNICEF colleagues. Without concrete leads or a thorough review of all of the numerous files of the UNON staff members who have obtained UN-SACCO loans, it is not possible to rule out similar fraudulent schemes undertaken by UNON staff., ID/OIOS noted with concern the ease with which locally recruited UNICEF staff, such as drivers, obtained access to official UNICEF stamps, stationeries and computers. UNON should ensure that there are adequate controls in place to prevent such abuses in UNON., Further, while analysing the fraudulent scheme at UNICEF/Somalia, ID/OIOS noted that when requests for letters of appointment suggesting contract renewal were denied, staff members produced fraudulent letters of appointment which were accepted by UN-SACCO management, although they were clearly different in style and format from legitimate letters., Furthermore, as noted above, in one case detected by ID/OIOS a letter of appointment, which stated that renewal for two years was subject to satisfactory performance, was provided to a UNON staff member. Such a letter, even from one with the authority to do so, is improper, may be used to demonstrate a staff member’s 'right' to a renewal, and should stop immediately.]   \n",
