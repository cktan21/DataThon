        "introduction": [
            "This case arises out of an audit report dated 28 February 2003 into the financial statements of Pristina International Airport conducted by the Chartered Accountants which led to an investigation concerning alleged corruption and irregularities arising in the course of procurements and contracts at Pristina International Airport.",
            "There are three specific allegations in this report of investigation: Employees overcharged commercial flights using Pristina Airport for handling and landing fees and other services; Employees failed to account for the money paid to them in handling and landing fees and other services; Employees requested and/or received corrupt payments in return for allocating landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times."

'Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2, leading to the institution of disciplinary measures for misconduct.'"

        "methodology": [
            "This investigation was conducted pursuant to Executive Decision No 2003/16 on the establishment of the Investigation Task Force. The ITF investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially implicated in the allegations; by obtaining documents from the Pristina Airport administration and from Pillar IV, which were then analysed for relevance to the inquiry at hand.",
            "This report details the findings resulting from these enquiries."

        "background_information": [
            "Pristina International Airport constitutes a state owned enterprise under Yugoslavian law. The assets of the airport include the runways, terminal buildings, hanger, fuel storage facilities and equipment. During the period covered by this investigation, from 2001 until 2003, they were maintained by the Public Enterprise Airport Pristina, (PEAP) in cooperation with Military Units of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 dated 10 June 1999, and UNMIK Regulation No 1/1999 dated 25 July 1999, UNMIK is mandated to administer the territory of Kosovo, including state owned and publicly owned assets. This includes Pristina International Airport.",
            "Until the end of June 2002, responsibility for the administration of the Pristina Airport was entrusted to the Civil Administration Pillar (Pillar II) of UNMIK, including Official 1 and Official 2. Pillar II supervised the Department of Transport and Infrastructure (DOTI) Official 1. The DOTI was later known as the Transport Sector of the UNMIK Directorate of Infrastructure Affairs. DOTI Official 1 left UNMIK at the end of June 2002. DOTI Official 2 was recruited by the DOTI as an international staff member on 31 July 2000 in charge of airport operations, reporting to DOTI Official 1, and continued in this role until 30 September 2001. Engineering expertise was provided by a series of engineers seconded from the armed forces of a United Nations member state, specifically Airport Engineer I, Airport Engineer 2 and Airport Engineer 3, and later by the Consultant from the Consulting Firm.",
            "On 1 July 2002, the responsibility for the administration of the Airport passed from Pillar II to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) and Pillar IV. The Divisional Manager was appointed at the Airport Sector, KTA at the same time. Under him were the PEAP Official and the Air Traffic Control Services (ATCS) Official.",
            "On 1 April 2004 Pristina International Airport, which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of KFOR was handed over to civilian jurisdiction, under ICAO regulations.",
            "It is against this background of change that procurement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined."

        "investigation_details": [
            "This case concerns allegations of corruption by staff at Pristina Airport arising from handling and landing fees levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport in the period January \u2013 December 2001. The case also deals with allegations of corruption arising from de-icing costs levied on passenger aircraft using the Airport during the same period and alleged requests for corrupt payments for the allocation of landing slots to airlines at the most convenient times.",
            "Samples were taken from a total of 21 airlines using the airport at Pristina in 2001. The year 2001 was selected due to the fact that fees appear to have been collected and receipts issued manually. Therefore, it was assessed that a greater risk of fraudulent activity existed.",
            "Where possible, similar dates and the type of aircraft were selected to allow for a comparative analysis of landing charges and passenger charges.",
            "An average price was then calculated for each type of aircraft by selecting a sample of landings for each airline and multiplied by the number of flights to give an estimate of the total income from landing fees.",
            "The ITF obtained a price list, dated 1 January 2002, which provides an indication as to the respective costs for basic airport services, based on the weight of the aircraft.",
            "The total income from landing fees in 2001 was estimated at DM 14,357,949 (equivalent to \u20ac7,341,163. This compares with a figure of \u20ac7,376,182 in the profit and loss accounts produced by the Chartered Accountants.",
            "This result suggests that in the absence of further information, the aircraft charges agreed with the figures produced in the official accounts of the Airport. However, the integrity of the information on which the accounts are based cannot be verified. The possibility therefore remains that airlines were routinely overcharged.",
            "It was noted that there are small variations in the prices charged to different airlines for the same type of aircraft. However, certain airlines appeared to have measurably lower costs. These were: Airline 1 \u2013 Average DM 2190; Airline 2 \u2013 Average DM 2888.",
            "The receipts books do not indicate whether Airline 1 carried passengers and if so, how many.",
            "It was notable that where aircraft requested de-icing facilities, this appears to have added considerably to the landing fees costs.",
            "A schedule was created detailing costs associated with de-icing. With the possible exception of one Airline 3 flight, this does not appear to indicate any obvious anomalies, although it again did not take into account the possibility that airlines were uniformly being overcharged for de-icing.",
            "Passenger taxes appear to be charged at 25 DM per passenger. A spreadsheet was created detailing the total number of persons travelling in the period 1 February 2001 until 31 December 2001 together with the number of persons not paying passenger tax. The file did not contain any data for the month of January 2001.",
            "The spreadsheet produced by the ITF indicated a total of 375,472 passengers during the relevant period, of whom, 18,996 did not pay the required passenger tax. If this number is multiplied by 25 DM and converted to Euro per paying passenger, this gives a total of \u20ac4,799,395 as against a stated income figure in the accounts of \u20ac4,919,190 for the whole year. This gap is diminished if a number of passengers were to be added for the month of January 2001.",
            "However, there remains a possibility that the passengers were not being charged airport tax when they should have been, or that the sums detailed in the accounts do not equate with sums actually paid.",
            "In an effort to verify whether or not airlines were being routinely overcharged for handling and landing fees or de-icing costs, the ITF sent a request to IATA to provide information from Airline 3, Airline 4, Airline 5 and Airline 6 concerning any instances of overcharging or extortion of money by staff at Pristina Airport. The request also sought information concerning any instances of corruption arising from the allocation of landing slots at Pristina Airport.",
            "Regrettably, to date, no substantive response has been received from the airlines or IATA."
        ],
        "conclusions": [
            "Whilst the figures for handling and landing fees broadly agree with the figures produced in the accounts of the Airport, it is not possible to ascertain whether the source of information forming the basis of the accounts is reliable.",
            "In the absence of cooperation from the Airlines and IATA, despite repeated requests by the ITF, it is not possible to progress the case further."
        ],
        "recommendations": [
            "It is therefore recommended that based on the results of this investigation, UNMIK should prepare an official request to the above-mentioned airlines in an effort to obtain their support and any information relevant to this matter."
