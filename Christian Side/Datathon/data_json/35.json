    "case_details": {
        "introduction": [
            "In April 2004, the Investigation Task Force (ITF) received information alleging possible violations of UNMUK procurement procedures involving the purchase of insurance cover for the Pristina Airport commencing as of 1 April 2004."
        ],
        "applicable_laws_and_procedural_rules": [
            "An agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA of 1 April 2004 specified the procedures for obtaining and maintaining appropriate insurances for the airport."
        ],
        "methodology": [
            "The ITF inquired with staff at Pristina Airport dealing with insurance issues, and analyzed correspondence between these staff members and ICAA representatives."
        ],
        "background_information": [
            "The insurance coverage arranged by ICAA commenced on 1 April 2004; however, previously obtained insurance policy for the airport - for the time-frame prior to 1 April 2004 - was not cancelled."
        ],
        "investigation_details": [
            "The documentation identified that the reason for double-coverage was the lack of a detailed insurance policy for the new coverage.",
            "KTA and Airport representatives had contacted ICAA several times for such policy documents and felt uncomfortable canceling the old policy without comprehensive information about the new one.",
            "A KTA Internal Audit Department staff member confirmed that no breaches of KTA rules, UNMIK procurement rules, or the above-mentioned agreement could be identified in the purchase of the new policy through the ICAA.",
            "The ITF further concludes that UNMIK procurement rules were not applicable to the ICAA as the agreement between UNMIK and the ICAA is prevailing and does not identify such a requirement.",
            "There is also no evidence of improper collusion or negotiations during the requisitioning process of the insurance policy, nor is there evidence that the process was corrupted."
        ],
        "conclusions": [
            "The ITF can report that comprehensive policy documents have been provided by the ICAA and the previous insurance policy has been cancelled."
        ],
        "recommendations": [],
        "others": [
            "If you have any questions or comments regarding this report, please do not hesitate to contact Mr. Mark Gough, Chief, Peacekeeping Investigations Unit, in our Vienna office at +43-1-26060-5406."
